<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Problem</h2>

With the need for software engineers and developers predicted to increase every year and the amount of coding bootcamps and courses multiplying to meet and capitalize on those needs the industry is faced with a unique problem. "How junior is too junior, for me?" ReadyDev.IO is the solution. With the knowledge that all bootcamps and programs are equal and neither are the students who attend them; the industry needs a baseline metric for these diverse and ever expanding skillsets. Perhaps you dont need a developer fluent in how to use sequelize or node to communicate with databases, but you do need them to be a front end genius, how do differentiate? How do you avoid wasting time and money on needless interviews? Most of all, how do you avoid overpaying? that well rounded developer wants 25% more than the developer who is more junior and knows just the skills you need them to. 
 
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Solution</h2>

ReadyDev.IO enables employers to redirect candidates to a screening test. Maximizing their recruiters efficiency and minimizing the time and cost of their hiring process.
<br>
By using our tests devloped by senior and staff developers from industry leaders, employers can insure the candidates that deserve their attention, get it.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Technology</h2>

ReadyDev.IO is a React app with an express backend utilizing a AWS hosted MongoDb database. 

For workflow development we pushed to Github via Gitbash, Trello for taskings, SMS for memes and communication, and slack for research and solution sharing.

Deployment was done with Heroku and you can view it here at [ReadyDev](www.readydev.io).
